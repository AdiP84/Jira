# Jira

I used the JIRA project management tool.

The project is an online store.

The product backlog: 2 stories and 4 tasks.

The chosen theme is "Wishlist".

The epic: as a customer, I want to be able to have a wishlist so that I can come back to buy products later.  

I attached print screens from the application.
